Plan a tree, so that the next generation can get air for free

Created from reusable plastic for a more eco-friendly future, our I-pot is designed to educate more young generations about preserving and protecting the earth. I-pot will be a refreshing wind and will bring tree planting to a new level. With many unique functions, this product is a step towards nature conservation. A special compartment on the I-pot supports the self-watering function. This product would have many attached electronic components to constantly update the users about the status of the tree. Donâ€™t be fast to judge and think that our I-pot would look bulky. Since our main targeted customers are children, I-pot would not only have an elegant but also trendy appearance.
